### ABSTRACT
Ending COVID-19 pandemic requires a collaborative understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 mechanisms. Yet, the evolving nature of coronaviruses results in a continuous emergence of new variants of the virus. Central to this is the need for a continuous monitoring system able to detect potentially harmful variants of the virus in real-time. In this manuscript, we present the International Database of SARS-CoV-2 Variations (IDbSV), the result of ongoing efforts in curating, analyzing, and sharing comprehensive interpretation of SARS-CoV-2's genetic variations and variants. Through user-friendly interactive data visualizations, we aim to provide a novel surveillance tool to the scientific and public health communities. The database is regularly updated with new records through a 4-step workflow (1-Quality control of curated sequences, 2-Call of variations, 3-Functional annotation, and 4-Metadata association). To the best of our knowledge, IDbSV provides access to the largest repository of SARS-CoV-2 variations and the largest analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with over 60 thousand annotated variations curated from the 1,808,613 genomes alongside their functional annotations, first known appearance, and associated genetic lineages, enabling a robust interpretation tool for SARS-CoV-2 variations to help understanding SARS-CoV-2 dynamics across the world.
